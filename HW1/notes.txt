1.  	Plot the temperature data as a function of year number.
	Use 1880 as year 0

2. 	Fit a line through the data (ax+b) where x is the year and a and b are the
	parameters you calculate.
	
3. 	Compute the differences between your model and the actual data and record
	the mean squared values of the data and the differences.

4. 	Predict the global average temperature for the year you turn 40.

Turn in:
	plots of the model
	the data
	values of a, b
	forecast global temperature
	one paragraph report
	program for calculating a & b as an appendix
